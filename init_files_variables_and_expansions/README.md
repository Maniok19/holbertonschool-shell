## Overview
In this directory, you will find scripts that cover the following topics:
- Working with shell variables
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Using parameter expansions
- Managing shell initialization files

## Scripts
Here is a list of the scripts included in this directory:
- `1-hello_you`: Prints a greeting message that includes the current user's name.
- `10-love_exponent_breath`: Calculates the result of raising the value of the `BREATH` variable to the power of the `LOVE` variable.

./1-hello_you
```
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts and perform the actions they describe.
