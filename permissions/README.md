- `3-new_owner`: Changes the owner of a file.
- `4-empty`: Creates an empty file.

## Usage

To use any of these scripts, simply run them in your terminal. For example, to change the owner of a file using the `3-new_owner` script, you would run:

```bash
./3-new_owner
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts and perform the actions they describe.

These scripts are part of the Holberton School curriculum and are designed to provide hands-on experience with managing file and directory permissions. Happy coding!
